## API Server: 
API is an interface which provide frontend or other user with expected data with some parameters. 

## Before we design an API service: 
To build up an API, we consider some factors first. 

- well-define status codes or status messages
- Secure your api service 
- Proper API documents
- Error handling with different scenerios

In the following tutorial, I will mention some important issues on API Design and use spring boot as a example. 

## What is spring boot? 
Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework used to create standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It simplifies the process of building and deploying Java applications by providing a set of conventions and defaults for application setup.
