## API Server: 
An API serves as an interface facilitating interaction between web applications or mobile apps and server-side functionalities. For instance, it enables tasks such as fetching or updating data through a specified URL.

## Before Designing an API Service: 
Before establishing an API, several key considerations come into play:

- Clearly defined status codes or status messages.
- Ensuring the security of your API service.
- Crafting concise API documents, potentially utilizing tools like Swagger.
- Implementing robust error handling mechanisms for various scenarios.

In the subsequent tutorial, I will delve into critical aspects of API design and illustrate using Spring Boot as an example.

## What is Spring Boot? 
Spring Boot is an open-source, Java-based framework designed for creating standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It streamlines the development and deployment of Java applications by offering a predefined set of conventions and defaults for application setup.

## How to Create a Spring Boot Application?

To initiate a Spring Boot application, follow these steps:

1. **Visit Spring Initializr:**
   Access the [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) website.

2. **Configure Your Project:**
   - Choose the project settings, such as language (typically Java), project type, and packaging.
   - Set the project's metadata, including group, artifact, and version.

3. **Select Dependencies:**
   - Pick the dependencies required for your project. Common choices include:
     - Spring Web: For building web applications.
     - Spring Data JPA: If you plan to interact with databases.
     - Thymeleaf or FreeMarker: For server-side templating.
     - Spring Boot DevTools: Facilitates development by offering automatic restarts and more.

4. **Generate the Project:**
   - Click the "Generate" button to create a ZIP file containing your configured project.

5. **Extract the Project:**
   - Download and extract the generated ZIP file to your desired location.

6. **Open in IDE (Integrated Development Environment):**
   - Import the project into your preferred IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code.

7. **Configure Java Version:**
   - Ensure that your Java environment meets the minimum version requirement, which is Java 17 for the stable Spring Boot version 3.2.0.

8. **Build and Run:**
   - Build the project using your IDE or build tools like Maven or Gradle.
   - Run the application to start your Spring Boot project.

**Note:**
- As of the provided information, the stable version of Spring Boot is 3.2.0.
- The minimum required Java version for this version of Spring Boot is Java 17. Ensure your Java environment is appropriately configured.
